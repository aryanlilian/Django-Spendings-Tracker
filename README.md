# Electronic-Spendings-Tracker
_I've built this website because I want to help a lot of people to manage their funds more efficiently and have a lot of savings every month, in order to start some small business or make a lot of investments._

#### Website Pages:
    - The Profile-Page is the pagw where users can set or update personal information and the currency of the wallet.

    - The Dashboard-Page is the page where you can add every time you want personalized spendings and budgets. All the spendings and budgets have a total and you get your current total automatically with our website every time you add a new spending or budget. The total savings = your total budgets - total spendings. On the Dashboard-Page you can see also how much of your budget are the spendings and the savings (in percentages). 

    - The Blog-Page is a page where you can read a lot of posts about money or how to manage them better and make savings, investments, etc. Also on this page for every post, you can write a comment and discuss it with other users on the website. 

    - Recently I've added a new feature that consists of making notes list and every list has a specific name, user, and a category. Every user can add as many tasks he/she wants in their list, every list and task has a full CRUD feature available.

    - Archive-Page is a new update, practically you can see all your spendings, budgets, and savings from a specific year and month, as an archive. All the information are selected from the database to make the user experience more efficient.
